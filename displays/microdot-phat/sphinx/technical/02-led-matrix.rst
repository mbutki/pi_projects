LED Matrices
------------

The LTP-305HR and LTP-305G matrices were first developed in 1971 by Texas Instruments, and are now manufactured by Lite-On.

They are available in red and green, and contain 5x7 LED pixels for displaying a single character, plus a decimal place.

The displays have 13 pins each connected to the nearest positive or negative rail within the display.
